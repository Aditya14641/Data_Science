# Data_Science
This code performs an extensive exploratory data analysis and machine learning on a student performance dataset. It begins with data loading, visualization (histograms, boxplots, countplots, pie charts), and mapping of categorical data for clearer interpretation (e.g., parental education, study time). It uses Seaborn and Plotly for visual insights into gender, study habits, school preferences, and performance. Pairplots and heatmaps help identify feature relationships. Clustering (K-Means and hierarchical) groups students by grades. Finally, it applies Decision Tree and SVM classifiers to predict final grades (G3) using features like study time and past grades, evaluating performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curves.
